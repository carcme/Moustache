# Moustache Fake Caller

Moustache

Fake caller experimental project - for when you really must dash


Moustache is a small, simple and free call simulator that offers a number of features to get you out of that unproductive meeting or those awkward situations we all too often find ourselves in.

Select from your contacts, pick a ring tone, set a delay until the call

Also a feature to start a call from the lock screen but that still needs some work!!
